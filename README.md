**Prerequisites :**
Before the program can be run Python must be installed on your system.

**Running the program :** 
Place yourself in the same directory as `main.py`
Type : 
`python main.py`
You will be asked for the starting node of the algorithm.
Result will look like that : 
`{'1': [True, 4, -1], '2': [True, 1, -1], '3': [True, 5, -1], '4': [True, 2, -1], '5': [True, 3, -1]}`
Where for each nodes *1*, *2*, etc. you'll see if they have been visited, their pre number, and post number.
